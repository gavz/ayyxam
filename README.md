The Danish Ministry of Education recently published a mandatory surveillance program for highschool exams called Den Digitale Prøvevagt (Translation: The Digital Exam Monitor).
This repository will host a bypass for the respective surveillance software and gradually update to combat their countermeasures..

# How to use
Inject the x86 module into the DDP process and specify your personal settings.

Note: The source code in the repository wont hide anything cheat-related, to prevent promotion of cheating.

# How does it work?

# Updates
+ V1 - Initial release, will update as soon as the ministry attempts to counter the bypass, if that ever happens.
