The Danish Ministry of Education recently published a mandatory surveillance program for highschool exams called Den Digitale Prøvevagt (Translation: The Digital Exam Monitor).
This repository will host a bypass for the respective surveillance software and gradually update to combat their countermeasures..

This program will also work for the commerical alternative ExamCookie.

# How to use
Inject the x86 module into the process and specify your personal settings.

Note: The source code in the repository wont hide anything cheat-related to prevent promotion of cheating.

# Updates
+ V1 - Initial release, will update as soon as the ministry attempts to counter the bypass, if that ever happens.
+ V2 - Updated to support ExamCookie, which is a privately-developed alternative
